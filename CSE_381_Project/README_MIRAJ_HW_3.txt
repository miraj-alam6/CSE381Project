ALL REQUIRED FEATURES OF THE HW ASSIGNMENT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED

Move with wsda, shoot with Left Click or Ctrl, jump with space.

I wanted to make the game a bit longer, so instead of Wolfie dying 
as soon as a zombie reaches it, I made it that each Wolfie has a
health bar. Your objective is to make sure that the 
wolfies survive as long as possible, and as soon as all 3 wolfies
are dead, you lose, and your score is how long it took until the
last wolfie to die. Also to make the game longer, I did not make
it that the game already starts with tons of zombies from the 
beginning. I made it that the spawn rate increases as the game
continues, thus eventually as you play more, more and more zombies
will spawn and eventually there indeed will be TONS OF ZOMBIES, as
the homework specification asked for.

Each Health bar is color coded, and orbs outside of each room will 
tell you which Wolfie is in which room, the color of the orbs will
correspond to the health bar color of the wolfie that is inside 
of it. The orbs in the air only serve the purpose of helping
the player navigate so that they can get to the room that they want
to get to based on the information they can analyze regarding
each of the wolfie's health bars.

When you lose, you have to restart manually by
pressing R. I chose to do it like this instead of automatically
restarting so that you can see the chaotic scenery of all the 
zombies that are still in the level and still spawning.

Another thing to keep in mind: I made a pink bar, that when
full, it means you can throw a brain. As you kill more and more
zombies your recharge rate your brain will decrease, thus as the
game gets harder, you get a bit "stronger" and better equipped to
deal with the difficulty, Eventually the difficulty will lead to
you losing because the game has to end sometimes, but with enough
strategy you can survive for very long.

All the gameplay occurs in the rooms on the first floor. No, zombies
or wolfies will be on the second floor.

There are 7 spawn points. 2 of them are in a room on the
first floor, 3 of them in another room on the first floor, 
and 2 of them are outside of the building.
